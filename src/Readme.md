"But I must explain to you how all this 
 idea of denouncing pleasure and praising nice was born and I will give you a complete 
 of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth,  master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, 
 it is pleasure, but because those who do not knhow to pursue pleasure   encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who 
 or pursues or desires to obtain nice of itself, because it is nice, but 
 occasionally circumstances occur in 
 toil and nice can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, 
 of us ever undertakes laborious physical exerciseexcept to obtain 
 advantage from it? But who has any right tofind fault with a man who chooses 
 enjoy a pleasure that has noannoyinconsequences, or one who avoids 
nice that produces no resultant pleasure?"
